mechanoChemistry code: modeling solid mechanics, chemistry, and their interactions

developed by: Greg Teichert and Dr. Shiva Rudraraju


Overview
=======================================================================
The mechanoChemistry code is an isogeometric analysis based code used to solve the partial differential equations describing solid mechanics (including gradient elasticity) and chemistry (including the Cahn-Hilliard phase field model). It is built on the PetIGA [https://bitbucket.org/dalcinl/petiga/] and PETSc [https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/] libraries, and it uses the automatic differentiation capabilities of the Sacado package from the Trilino library [https://trilinos.org/packages/sacado/].


Installation
=======================================================================
1) Install PETSc:

-Download and extract PETSc source code.
-Quick installation as follows (the symbol $ denotes the command prompt):

	$ ./configure --with-cc=gcc --with-cxx=g++ --with-fc=gfortran --download-fblaslapack --download-mpich
	$ make all test

-Set the appropriate PETSC_DIR and PETSC_ARCH environment variables, e.g.

	$ export PETSC_DIR=/path/to/petsc-3.6.4
	$ export PETSC_ARch=arch-linux2-c-debug

Note that this also installs mpich. It is possible to use an existing version of mpi by including a flag to its directory. If you will be using the local PETSc installation of mpich, set the following:

	$ alias mpirun=$PETSC_DIR/$PETSC_ARCH/bin/mpirun

2) Install PetIGA:

-Download and extract or clone the PetIGA source code.

-Enter the PetIGA top directory and install using make:

	$ make all
	$ make test

-Export path to PetIGA directory:

	$ export PETIGA_DIR=/path/to/petiga/

Download: https://bitbucket.org/dalcinl/petiga/downloads (or clone the bitbucket repository)

3) Install CMake:

Download: https://cmake.org/download/


4) Install the Sacado package from Trilinos (version 11.10.2 recommended)

-Download and extract or clone the Trilinos source code.
-Simple installation of Sacado as follows (from the Trilinos top directory), with the desire /path/to/trilinos/installation/:

	$ mkdir build
	$ cd build
	$ cmake -DTrilinos_ENABLE_Sacado=ON -DTrilinos_ENABLE_Teuchos=OFF -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/trilinos/installation/ ../
	$ make install

-Export path to Trilinos:

	$ export TRILINOS_DIR=/path/to/trilinos/installation/
